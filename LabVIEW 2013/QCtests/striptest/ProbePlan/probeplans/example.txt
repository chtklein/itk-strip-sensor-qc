Example probe plan
===================
there must be at least one region defined by the REGION=label line.
Eg:
REGION=Segment 1
The REGION= declaration must come BEFORE the probe point declarations.

A probe point is defined as LABEL=<some label> X=x-coord Y=y-coord
The X and Y corrds is the probe position relative to a reference point on the sensor
eg fiducial
Eg:

Label=Strip one X=-350 Y=20
